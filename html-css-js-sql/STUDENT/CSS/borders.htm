<H2>Mind Fodder and More</H2>

<P>Need some quiet time away from your home or office? Need to put the speed and chaos of modern life in the backseat for a while? Sometimes, a little solitude buried in the pages of a good book is all you'll need. Visit with a friend over a super large double cappuccino or a fruit smoothie. Take a break from the everyday routine and pick up one of our award-winning desserts. You can do all these things at Books & Beyond.</P>


<H2>What is Books & Beyond?</H2>

<P>Some say it's a bookstore. Some call it a music shop, while others think of it as a great place to meet and relax. Books & Beyond has become a unique phenomenon that offers this area’s largest selection of sale books and music, with an inventory of CDs and tapes ranging from classical to independent-label rock and everything in between.</P>

<P>What makes us different is our atmosphere. We encourage you to relax with a book in one of our quiet rooms, or take some reading material into our Coffee and Juice Bar to read while snacking. Think of Books & Beyond as your own den. </P>


<H2>Best Sellers and the Classics</H2>

<P>We have the largest selection of books of any bookstore in the galaxy. You'll always find a special display of the current New York Times nonfiction best sellers, as well the Classics, both in hard cover and paperback. Each book category is found in its own section complete with easy chairs and benches, so you can browse through your selections in comfort and quiet.</P>
