<h3>History of Coffee</h3></summary>
The origin of coffee dates back to <mark>600 A.D.</mark> There are several legends about the origin of coffee, one of which states that in Eastern Africa, a shepherd called <strong><em>Kaldi</em></strong> observed that his goats were overactive when they ate cherry-red berries from a shrub. He tried to eat some of the berries, and found himself invigorated too. Soon, news spread about the stimulating effects of these berries, and monks started using the berries to stay awake during their long hours of prayer.
From Eastern Africa, coffee was transported to Arabia and then to Turkey, where they roasted the beans and boiled them and gave rise to a crude form of coffee that we use today. Soon, coffee spread to Europe, America, and other continents. It is one of the most popular beverages enjoyed by multitudes of people all over the world and is available in different varieties. Some of the international favorites are Cappucino, Mocha, Latte, and Frapp&eacute.</details>
