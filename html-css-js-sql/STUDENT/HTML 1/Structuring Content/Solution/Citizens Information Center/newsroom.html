<h3>Chermont:</h3></hgroup>

Youngsters showed keen interest in honing their individual talents.
</aside>
<p class="bodypara">At the County Fair held last Tuesday, a number of young people from across the county participated and walked away with prizes. Over the past year, the youngsters showing a keen interest in honing their talents sewed dresses, planned parties, raised unusual animals as pets, crafted artworks, held painting exhibitions etc. to impress the judges at the Fair with their unique skills.</p>

<h3>Some of the stories include:</h3>

<p class="bodypara">Reece Wanders brought a painted pony to the fair. The 14 year old won a blue ribbon and Best of show for the painted carousel horse. "People often throw away these treasures when their children no longer use them because they don't realize their worth" explained Reece. "I love to paint them and restore them to their old glory."</p>

<p class="bodypara">10-year-old Christina, a member of the Young Earthian Club, baked a cake fit for a princess. With an interesting theme like Cinderella going to the ball, the rounded cake coach was indeed a sight to see. It sat on a quarter sheet cake iced in white frosting. It had red icing wheels and strings of small pearls around the side openings. Two white horses and one black horse, each carrying a candle in its saddle, drew the coach. The words <mark>"Happy birthday"</mark> were inscribed in blue icing. Needless to say, it won the Best of Class and Showcase.</p>
