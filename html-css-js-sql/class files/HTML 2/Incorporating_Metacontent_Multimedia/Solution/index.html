<h1>History of Coffee</h1>
<p class="s2">
The origin of coffee dates back to 600 A.D. There are several legends about the origin of coffee, one of which states that in Eastern Africa, a shepherd called Kaldi observed that his goats were overactive when they ate cherry-red berries from a shrub. He tried to eat some of the berries, and found himself invigorated too. Soon, news spread about the stimulating effects of these berries, and monks started using the berries to stay awake during their long hours of prayer.
<br/>
<br/>
From <span>Eastern Africa</span>, coffee was transported to <span>Arabia</span> and then to <span>Turkey</span>, where they roasted the beans and boiled them and gave rise to a crude form of coffee that we use today. Soon, coffee  spread to <span>Europe</span>, <span>America</span>, and other  continents, and now it is one of the most popular beverages enjoyed by multitudes of people all over the world.</p>
